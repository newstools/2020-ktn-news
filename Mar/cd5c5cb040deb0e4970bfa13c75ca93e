Tens of people have been injured and hundreds of others forced to flee their homes in Mandera town following fierce gun fighting between Somalia troops and Jubaland forces. The clashes which started at 11 in the morning have crippled business in Mandera town which is approximately 3km from the battleground. The crash happenedÂ just hours after 11 Kenyan MPs traveled to Somalia to meet president Mohamed Farmajo whose administration wants Kenya to hand over a fugitive from Jubaland seeking political asylum in Kenya.
