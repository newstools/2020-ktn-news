Five banks have paid 385 million shillings for administrative lapses in internal anti money laundering controls in the NYS 2 saga.  KCB, equity, co?operative bank, standard chartered bank, and diamond trust bank have paid the money into the prosecution fund. It was paid as part of a deferred prosecution agreement between the banks and the office of the DPP. The agreement which is provided for in the constitution is reached between the prosecution and a corporate organization that would otherwise be prosecuted for a corporate offense.? These were part of the revelations made today in a press briefing held by the DPP and DCI this morning.
