A section of Kitui leaders has protested the government’s decision to reduce the length of the Kibwezi?Mutomo?Kitui?Mwingi road by 17 kilometers due to funding constraints. The leaders have raised concerns over emerging reports that the 200-kilometer road project is set to terminate at Migwani in Mwingi West, some 17 kilometers from the Thika?Garissa highway at Mbondoni junction. Led by Mwingi West MP Charles Nguna, the leaders have urged the government to mobilize extra resources to ensure that the project is done in full. He noted that the 18.5 billion shillings road will ease congestion on the Nairobi– Mombasa highway besides boosting mobility of goods and services to and from the Mombasa port.
