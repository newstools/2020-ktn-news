The Standard Group has launched a motherâ€™s room at the city center office as a way of expressing love to mothers. The standard Group already has a mother's room here at the headquarters and the new one unveiled by the group CEO Orlando Lyomu at I&M building is a welcome addition. President of standard Women Network Quinter Mbori hailed the move saying many mothers at the standard group will be more comfortable at the workplace.
