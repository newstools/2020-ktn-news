Kinrinyaga Woman Rep Wangui Ngurici has called for the dissolution of Parliament, the national executive, and the county Governments to pave way for fresh elections. Ngirici says that leaders in both the national government have lost touch with the electorate and the only way out is for all the elected leaders to seek a fresh mandate from the electorate. The MP blames the Building Bridges Initiative popularization campaigns for polarizing the country and trashing President Kenyattaâ€™s big four development agendas.
