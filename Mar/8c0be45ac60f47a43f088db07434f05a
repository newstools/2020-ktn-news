Many Africans find it hard to identify with their cultural values and way of life as a result of embracing modernization and western culture. However, one man in Elgeyo Marakwet has taken it upon himself to preserve the fading culture of the Keiyo community, which is part of the Kalenjin subtribes. Joseph Kwambai, 70, said modernization has changed the African society from a traditional socio?economic setup to where locals have now adapted to new norms and ways of life.
