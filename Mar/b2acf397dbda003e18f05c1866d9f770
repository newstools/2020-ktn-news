Nairobi County Woman Rep Esther Passaris has assured Kenyans that there is no case of coronavirus in Kenya, especially in Kenyatta hospital. The MP also called on people spreading fake news about the disease on social media stop immediately. Fears grew wild last week when a plane carrying 239 passengers from china, the epicenter of coronavirus outbreak, landed at the JKIA. Passaris spoke at twendekazi mobile film awards in Nairobi.
