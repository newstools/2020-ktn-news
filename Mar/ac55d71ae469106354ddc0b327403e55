Nakuru governor Lee Kinyanjui will be putting on a brave face to present the county as a united front during the eighth edition of the building bridges initiative (BBI) consultative forum which will be held in Nakuru this Saturday. Leaders in the county have been sharply divided since 2017, over the 2022 presidential succession race. One faction of the leaders is strongly behind deputy president William Ruto's presidential bid while the other has rallied behind president Uhuru Kenyatta's handshake with ODM party leader Raila Odinga and the BBI push.
