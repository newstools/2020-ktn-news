Nairobi governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko has received a temporary reprieve after the high court stopped an impeachment motion against him. According to a ruling delivered by justice Byrum Ongaya, the motion sponsored by Makongeni MCA Peter Imwatok shall not proceed until it is filed in compliance with the standing orders of the county assembly. Sonko had moved to the court objecting to the motion on grounds that the clerk was not served with the motion or even verified the signatures in support of the governor after meeting the president.
