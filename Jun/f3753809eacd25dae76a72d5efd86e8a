The minority party in the national assembly? NASA has Offaly started the process of removing Malindi legislator Aisha Jumwa as its representative in the powerful Parliamentary service commission.  In what appears to be a Politically and legally calculated move, NASA through Rarieda mp Otiende  Amollo has invoked article 127 of the Constitution and now want the speaker of the National Assembly to give directions, which if he concurs with their Pitch, then Aisha Jumwa will be kicked out in less than a Month. Duncan khaemba is on that beat.
