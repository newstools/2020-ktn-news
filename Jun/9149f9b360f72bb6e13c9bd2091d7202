President Uhuru Kenyatta has urged Kenyans to emulate the late professor Wangari Maathai passion and achievements in the conservation of the environment. The president said it is the conservation efforts of great Kenyans like the late Nobel laureate that the country remains one of the most biodiverse nations in the world. The head of state spoke at the Nairobi arboretum where he led government and private sector representatives in a tree planting exercise to commemorate this year's world environment day.
