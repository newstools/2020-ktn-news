Agriculture CS Peter Munya has fired a government contractor for failing to fulfill the stipulated objectives of his contract for the last seven years. The CS, accompanied by the president's delivery unit, carried out an inspection of the Bachuma processing zone, which has stalled for the last one year for no valid reasons. More than sh.100 million has been paid to the contractor to facilitate its completion. The project is expected to pump over sh.100 billion into the government through meat processing when completed.
