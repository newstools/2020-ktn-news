Fresh produce farmers in Kinangop, in the county of Nyandarua, are crying foul over failure by the government to enforce the 50kg potato packaging rule. according to them, brokers were still buying potatoes in extended bags despite the rule, a move that was reducing their profit margins. This came as it emerged prices of potatoes, snow peas, cabbages, and carrots had dropped by 20 percent due to the closure of hotels in various parts of the country.
