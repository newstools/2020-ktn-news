Kisumu county workers have protested delay in the payments of their January salaries, saying this is a deliberate move by the county leadership to frustrate them. The workers, drawn from various trade unions, told journalists that the payment through cheques that the government adopted to weed out ghost workers is hurting them, and they have urged governor Anyang Nyongo to come to their rescue.
