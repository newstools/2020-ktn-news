The national cohesion and integration commission has called for unity in discussing the building bridges initiative. NCIC commissioner Makori Danvas says utterances regarding BBI must unite, not divide the county since its main agenda is unity and inclusivity.  The commission has now set up 12 guidelines and principals to guide conversations on the BBI.
