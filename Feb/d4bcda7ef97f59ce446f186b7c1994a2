Politicians and elected leaders from the 7 counties where the Maa community reside have resolved to put aside their political differences and support the Building Bridges Initiative started by the president and the opposition leader. In a meeting chaired by ODM party leader Raila Odinga, the leaders shelved any other BBI rally and agreed to organize and attend one BBI rally scheduled for this Saturday in Narok county. Meanwhile, third-way alliance party led by dr. Ekuru Aukot has launched a revamped punguza mizigo constitutional amendment bill, months after a similar initiative failed to win the approval of county assemblies as required in law.
