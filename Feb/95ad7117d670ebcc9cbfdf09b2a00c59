Members of parliament representative people living with disabilities are now calling on the BBI steering committee to set day for people living with disabilities to present their memorandum. The group argues that the report by the BBI team did not address challenges facing them and are seeking more inclusion leadership positions. Bbi rallies are back and headed to Narok this weekend to get views from the maa region.
