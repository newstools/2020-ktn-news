Kenya is staring at a blood transfusion crisis. The kenya national blood transfusion service is yet to procure  blood screening reagents after the president's emergency plan for aids relief funding came to an end. The country needs at least 14 billion shillings to process blood for transfusion, but the kenya national blood transfusion service has been allocated less than a billion shillings.
