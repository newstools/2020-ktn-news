Terrorists mounted a Sunday dawn attack on a military base used by both US and Kenyan forces in Lamu County, the Department of Defence (DoD) has confirmed. DoD spokesman Col. Paul Njuguna said they repulsed the Al-Shabaab insurgents who tried to take control of the Manda airstrip, killing four terrorists. He added that the airstrip was safe of the 5.30 am attack. “Arising from the unsuccessful breach, a fire broke out affecting some of the fuel tanks located at the airstrip,” Njuguna told us, adding, “The fire has been put under control and standard security procedures are now on-going.”
