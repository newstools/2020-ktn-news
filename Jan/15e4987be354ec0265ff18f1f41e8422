Brighton Otieno, a 2019 KCPE candidate from Migori county whose parents were unable to raise school fees for his admission at Mang'u high school has finally secured a scholarship after KTN news aired a story on his plight a few days ago. Otieno, who scored more than 400 marks in last year's kcpe examinations, was admitted at the school yesterday after the Mang'u alumni association came to his aid. Otieno had initially applied for three differentÂ scholarships to no avail.
