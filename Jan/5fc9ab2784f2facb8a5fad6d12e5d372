Gatundu south member of parliament Moses Kuria will plead to charges of assault on Tuesday. Chief magistrate Martha Mutuku dismissed Kuria's application to defer plea taking until a miscellaneous application he had filed on the disobedience of court orders, is heard and determined. The lawmaker through his lawyers sought anticipatory orders barring the state from rearresting him.
