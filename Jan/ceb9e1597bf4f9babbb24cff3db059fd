Residents and the management of a vocational training college in Webuye, Bungoma county, are calling upon the national government to intervene so as to revive operations of the multi?purpose industrial plant that has remained non?functional nearly two years since it was established. The agricultural value addition plant was installed by the Chinese government at Webuye west technical and vocational college at a cost of 100 million shillings, with the expectations of enhancing self?sustainability at the college and create employment for local youth.
