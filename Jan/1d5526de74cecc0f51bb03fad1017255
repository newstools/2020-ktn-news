Embattled Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waititu will now have to fight his impeachment before all the 47 elected and 20 nominated senators. This is after the senate resoundingly rejected a proposal to have the governor tried by an 11 member select committee. The raging 2022 succession politics seems poised to wade into Waititu’s impeachment trial, as senators raise queries on the likelihood of individual members being compromised to suit external political interests in the Waititu matter.
