Police lobbed teargas in the air to disperse rowdy Egerton university students, who were protesting outside university this morning. The students were irked by the university #39;s directive barring those who have not paid a 16 thousand shillings damages fee from accessing the institution and sitting for their examinations. Vice-chancellor professor Rose Mwonya has defended the institution #39;s decision on the damage fee saying it's meant to maintain order.
