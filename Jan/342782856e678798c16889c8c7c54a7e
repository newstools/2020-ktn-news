Embattled University of Nairobi vice-chancellor Stephen Kiama has sent deputy vice chancellor for finance Isaac Mbeche on leave with effect from January sixth and appointed Madara Ogot to act for the period. The developments come a day after the employment and labour relations court suspended the directive to revoke Kiama's appointment as VC. Professor Kiama says he is firmly in office as the University of Nairobi vice-chancellor with a lot on his in-tray.
