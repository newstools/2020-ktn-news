The body of the late k24 news anchor Anjlee Gadhvi was cremated today at the Kariokor Hindu crematorium. The jovial Anjlee who was also a former KTN news anchor, had been battling both lung and liver cancer.  She succumbed to the disease Friday at Aga khan hospital in Nairobi.  Family and friends held a funeral service at the Lohana hall opposite Nairobi Gymkhana on forest road before her body was taken to the crematorium.  Anjlee was first diagnosed with cancer in 2013.  She underwent a series of medical procedures in and out of the country.  In 2018, Anjlee flew to India for a treatment procedure known as the cyber knife system that uses robotic radiation to treat cancerous and non cancerous tumors.  She leaves behind a husband and two children.
