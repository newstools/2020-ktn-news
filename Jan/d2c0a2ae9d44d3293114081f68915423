President Uhuru Kenyatta has extended the term of the steering committee on the implementation of the Building Bridges Initiative. The mandate of the BBI taskforce was extended in a gazette notice issued today. The 14 member team is expected to oversee the implementation of the BBIreport. The committee will be required to conduct a validation of the BBI report through consultations with citizens, civil society and faith-based organizations as well as the private sector cultural leaders and experts. However, at the same time activist Okiya Omtata has filed a petition in court, seeking to stop president Kenyatta's extension of the BBI team's mandate.
