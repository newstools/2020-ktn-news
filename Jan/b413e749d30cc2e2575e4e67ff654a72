The high court has ordered the attorney general Paul nbsp;Kihara Kariuki to give his position on the disobedience of court orders in the Miguna Miguna case. Justice John Mativo ruled that the attorney general can appear in person or delegate. The ag was expected to appear in court today but instead sent representatives much to the chagrin of Miguna's lawyer john Khaminwa. Khaminwa nbsp;rejected the representatives arguing that disobedience of court orders is a serious issue and needs the ag's attention.
