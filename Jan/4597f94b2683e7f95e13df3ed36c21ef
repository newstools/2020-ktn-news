The government through the ministry of agriculture has orderedÂ the KCC to pay farmers sh.33 per litre up from sh.25 shillings per litre. This follows president Uhuru Kenyatta's economic directives to revamp the country's dairy sector. Treasury was also directed to release sh.500 million for purchasing excess milk from farmers and another sh.575 million for constructing new milk processing plants in Nyeri and Nyahururu. A 16% vat tax has equally been imposed on all milk products from outside the East African community.
