The Centre for Multi Party Democracy Kenya wants political parties to create a conducive environment for free, fair and credible party primaries. The call comes at a time when ODM, Jubilee and Wiper parties are planning to hold their elections by March this year. ODM Deputy Party leader Wycliffe Oparanya has warned that skewed party nominations have scuttled the partyâ€™s dream to capture power and wants the party to censure officials, who manipulate nomination results. In Jubilee, politicians allied to Deputy President William Ruto have demanded that the party holds its elections by March, when the three year term of the current interim office holders led by Secretary General Raphael Tuju comes to an end.
