Nairobi governor Mike Mbuvi Sonko has nominated Anne Kananu Mwenda for the position of deputy governor. In a letter to the Nairobi county assembly speaker Beatrice Elachi, the embattled governor said his decision was in line with article  180(5) of the constitution and the supreme court advisory of march 2018. The governor also cited the recent corruption charges against him currently before the court that require him as a governor to stay out of office until the determination of the matter as another motivation to fill up a position that has been vacant since January 2018.Anne Kananu Mwenda is currently the chief officer in charge of disaster management and coordination at the county as well as the chief officer in charge of water in an acting capacity. Sonko in his letter to Elachi has called for a speedy vetting of his nominee. The nomination comes nearly two years since Sonko’s first deputy Polycarp Igathe resigned. However, the DPP Noordin haji has termed this nomination as a violation of bail terms preferred against governor Mike Sonko on the 19 counts of corruption charges he faces. Haji has vowed to move to court as soon as Wednesday to challenge the nomination.
