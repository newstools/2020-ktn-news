Embattled Gatundu South legislator Moses Kuria has finally been released after spending more than twenty four hours behind bars.  In what has been interpreted as yet another case of open defiance by the state to follow court orders, the MP’s detention saw a night of drama ensue between supporting legislators and the police who engaged in running battles at the Kilimani police post.
