A section of western leaders opposed to today’s BBI meeting in Kakamega’s Bukhungu stadium failed to have their parallel rally. Police dispersed every crowd that gathered near the leaders in different centres on the outskirts of Mumias town, rendering the Bomani grounds meeting impossible. But as Kevin Ogutu reports, the leaders claimed that majority whip in the national assembly and Mumias East member of parliament Benjamin Washiali was missing, and therefore possibly abducted.
