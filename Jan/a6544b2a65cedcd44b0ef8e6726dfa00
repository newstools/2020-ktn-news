Every allegation leveled against me is propaganda and I should be given justice and a fair hearing and judgement those were the words of embattled Kiambu governor Ferdinand Waituti as he spoke before the senate this morning. The governor will know his fateÂ as the senate votes at a special session to hear impeachment charges MCAs filed against him. Waititu will only be impeached if 24 of the 47 counties vote to support the petition by Kiambu MCAs to oust him. The senate holds a plenary meeting today to hear the charges and decide whether to uphold the Kiambu MCAs bid or dismiss the charges.
