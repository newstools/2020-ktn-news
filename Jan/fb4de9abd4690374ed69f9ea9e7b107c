Ibrahim Akasha has been handed a 23 year jail term by a us federal court, after Ibrahim and his brother Baktash Akasha, pleaded guilty to the offence of drug trafficking and other related charges. His brother Baktash was sentenced last year to a 25 year jail term. Back home anti drugs organizations have welcomed the sentencing and called on Kenyan courts to emulate the gesture.
