The leadership wrangles at the university of Nairobi are now threatening to cripple the running of the institution. There are reports that workers’ salaries have not been paid, even as the process of receiving and registering new first year students continues to face uncertainty. Meanwhile divisions have begun to emerge within the university’s students; one faction is supporting professor Isaac Mbeche while the other appears to throws its weight behind professor Peter Kiama. And as Shadrack Mitty reports, the university staff have reiterated their support for professor Mbeche, insisting as employees of a government institution, they are under every obligation not to disrespect the position taken by the education cabinet secretary.
