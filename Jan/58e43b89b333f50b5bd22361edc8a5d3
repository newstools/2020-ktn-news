Health Cabinet secretary Sicily Kariuki has today initiated the signing of an intergovernmental partnership agreement with ten governors, largely from central Kenya, aimed at boosting universal health care. The agreement follows up an existing universal health care program dubbed Afya care, which had its pilot phase launched in four counties, Kisumu, Nyeri, Isiolo, and Machakos. Governors from Nyeri, Meru, Nyandarua, Tharaka Nithi, Kirinyaga among other leaders from the central block economic unit signed the partnership with the ministry of health to boost health in their counties. this comes against the backdrop of the controversy surrounding the restructuring of the national hospital insurance fund, NHIF.
