Former Molo mp Njenga Mungai has launched a scathing attack on deputy president William Ruto terming him unfit to hold office. Mungai has sensationally claimed that the DP and his allies are reincarnating the infamous yk92 into yk2022 and are sinking the economy. Bahati mp Kimani Ngunjiri, a Ruto diehard supporter has however come to his defense saying the utterances are only meant to derail the DP's quest to the statehouse.
