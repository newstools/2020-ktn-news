As other pupils in the country reported back to school for term one, pupils of Tiritagoi primary school in Njoro Nakuru county did not.  This is after hundreds of parents blocked the school’s main gate demanding for the immediate transfer of the school headteacher Danson Miangare whom they accuse of taking down the school in terms of performance. The parents further accuse the headteacher of misusing school property and facilities.
