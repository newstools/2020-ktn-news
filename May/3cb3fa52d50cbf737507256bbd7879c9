Kenya has now crossed the 900 COVID?19 cases mark with 25 new positive results detected in the last 24 hours. The total now stands at 912 cases. However, it is emerging that this number could have hit the 1,000 marks earlier had Kenya not imposed cessation of movement across the Tanzanian and Somalia borders. In the last 48 hours alone, 65 foreign truck drivers who tested positive for covid19 have been sent back to Tanzania.
