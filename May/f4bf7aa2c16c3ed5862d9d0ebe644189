James Kifo Muriuki, a 30-year-old man who allegedly sealed his wife’s private parts with superglue will now undergo psychiatric assessment pending his bail application ruling on 19th June this year. Appearing before Chuka high court senior resident magistrate Njoki Kahara a day after his arrest, the accused denied all 3 counts of assault. The prosecution is however seeking to have the accused denied bail until his trial begins.  In the meantime, Kifo has been remanded at the Embu GK prison.
