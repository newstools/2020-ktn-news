Mothers day marked on every second Sunday of May is a celebration honoring the mother of the family, as well as motherhood, maternal bonds, and the influence of mothers in society. Tonight we bring you a unique mother who defied her condition and went to a terror scene all in a desperate attempt to rescue her daughter who is lucky to have survived the attack without picking a scar. Duncan Khaemba traced a mother and daughter and brings us the following report of a truly a mother's undying love as we mark Mother's Day.
