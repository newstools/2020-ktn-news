Health Cabinet secretary Mutahi Kagwe is expected to appear before the national assembly health committee tomorrow to answer to audit queries in the ministry. Questions have been raised over the ministry's handling of COVID?19 funds. And as Shadrack Mitty reports, the committee is also seeking answers on the whereabouts of recent testing kits donated by philanthropist Jack Ma.
