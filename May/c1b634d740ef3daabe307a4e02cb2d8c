World press freedom day is commemorated every year on the 3rd of May in support of the media seeking to guard against violations of press freedom. It is also a day of remembrance for journalists who lost their lives in the pursuit of a story. Here in Kenya, 2020 seems to paint a demoralizing picture if recent attacks on media practitioners and targeted media revenue starvation are anything to go by.
