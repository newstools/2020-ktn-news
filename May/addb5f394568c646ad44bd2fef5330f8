The national assembly has dismissed a document circulating on social media purported to be the order paper for next Tuesdayâ€™s sitting when the national assembly returns from one-month recess. Clerk of the national assembly Michael Sialai has termed the document as fictitious even as jubilee factions of kieleweke and tangatanga engage in finger-pointing over the matter.
