Tharaka Nithi senator kithure kindiki is set to know his fate today when the senate holds a special sitting to vote on aÂ motion seeking to remove him as deputy speaker. Kindiki's ouster bid was occasioned by a failure to attend a senate parliamentary group meeting convened by president kenyatta at state house. Senators kipchumba murkomen and Susan kihika have already lost their powerful positions in the house.
