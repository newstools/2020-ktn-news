Uasin Gishu woman representative Gladys Shollei has criticised president Uhuru Kenyatta over the ongoing purge in jubilee party that has seen leaders allied to deputy president William Ruto ousted in the senate. Shollei who is the chair of delegated legislation in national assembly says the removal of committee leaders allied to deputy president William Ruto was unwarranted. She says she is ready to lose her position in the delegated legislation as well.
