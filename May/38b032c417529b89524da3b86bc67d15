The penetration of Kenya's insurance sector rose to 3.47% in 2020 from last year's 3%. This marks a new high for the sector. This is according to a survey by the insurance information bureau. The growth is attributed to new distribution channels such as Bancassurance and online platforms. These have boosted the customer's access to the products. The survey shows that motor vehicle and medical insurance are still the most sought after products in the market.  It attributes free primary and secondary education to the poor performance of education policies.  The report recommends improved customer service and data-based profiling to boost performance in the sector.
