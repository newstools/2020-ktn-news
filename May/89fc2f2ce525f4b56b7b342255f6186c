ODM officials in Trans Nzoia have called on the party’s top leadership to hand over the deputy minority whip slot at the national assembly to Saboti Mp Caleb Amisi in planned reorganization. The orange party might reclaim the position if the national super alliance stands dissolved with its constituent parties angling towards forging a new alliance with the ruling Jubilee Party. The official led by chairman county steering committee John Otieno said they are fully behind the party’s intention to borrow a leaf from the Jubilee party of ensuring rebels are relieved off-key roles in house leadership to avoid sabotage. The officials have also denounced any relationship with ford Kenya officials in the region saying they will not put up with a requirement to play second fiddle.
