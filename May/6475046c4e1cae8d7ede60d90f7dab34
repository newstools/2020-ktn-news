The ruling Jubilee party and one of the longest surviving parties in the country KANU have now legalized their decision to form a post-election coalition ahead of the 2022 general elections. Both political parties have already forwarded the signed agreements to the registrar of political parties who have already confirmed receiving the documents. This move comes only hours before president Uhuru Kenyatta chairs a Jubilee parliamentary group meeting that will only consist of senators at state house Nairobi. And as our senior political affairs reporter Chris Thairu reports, one of the agendas of the statehouse meeting is to deliberate the possibility of changing the leadership of the senate and favor KANU by replacing the majority leader Kipchumba Murkomen with West Pokot senator Samuel Pogishio.
